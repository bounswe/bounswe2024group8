### appFanatic

#### Overview

Fanatic is a discussion forum application dedicated to fans of the Turkish football league. It offers a platform for users to engage in discussions, share insights, and connect with other enthusiasts of Turkish football. The application integrates semantic search capabilities powered by Wikidata, providing enriched context and deeper insights into discussions related to players, teams, and matches.

#### Features

Discussion Forums: Users can participate in forums specific to teams. The forums are designed to facilitate community discussions, match analysis, and team support.
Semantic Search: Powered by Wikidata, the search function allows users to query information about players or teams, yielding rich, context-aware results that enhance user discussions and content discovery.
User Profiles: Each user can create a personalized profile, which tracks their posts, discussions, and interaction within the community.


Fanatic utilizes a robust stack to deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience:

**Frontend**: The user interface is built with React, offering a dynamic and responsive design.
**Backend**: The server-side logic is handled by Spring Boot, ensuring efficient data processing and API management.
**Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, providing reliable management of user data and forum content.
**Search**: Integration with Wikidata via their public API enhances the search functionality, allowing semantic search queries directly within the app.
