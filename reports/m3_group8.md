# 1 Executive Summary

## 1.1 Summary of Project Status

As of the final milestone, we were able to successfully implement and test all the planned features in backend and frontend with mobile still lacking several minor ones. Overall, we are satisfied with the number and the diversity of our features and ideas. We also think that we have managed to process the feedbacks we have received into valuable outcomes, especially after the second milestone. As a result, our efforts culminated in a functional app, which we believe serves well to its' target audience.

## 1.3 Final Release Notes

Our final release notes can be found under our latest release, [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/releases/tag/customer-milestone-3).   

## 1.4 Changes since last milestone

As far as our development process is concerned, we have taken several decisions after the last milestone. Organizing more meetings between Frontend and Mobile teams was the most significant change we have applied. With this change, we aimed to maintain the design consistency across these two platforms. Furthermore, since Frontend team was ahead of the Mobile team in terms of number of implemented features, they guided Mobile team on the details of the implementation. Another approach we have changed was the task prioritization. Especially for the Backend team, we have thoroughly discussed which features to rule out and which ones to implement based on the feedback from the second customer milestone. As a result of these changes, we were able to bring new features in a more complete state and also further improve the existing ones.

## 1.5 Final Milestone Demo Reflections

## 1.5.1 Challenged Posts
### Current Issue:
Users cannot easily view comments for both the original and challenging posts on the same screen, making it difficult to compare feedback.

### Suggested Improvements:
- Enable a feature to display comments for both posts in a challenged post scenario on the same screen for better clarity and engagement.

---

## 1.5.2 Most Interaction Section
### Current Issue:
There is no dedicated space to highlight posts with the highest engagement, making it harder for users to discover popular content.

### Suggested Improvements:
- Add a section for posts that receive the most interaction to showcase trending designs and encourage user participation.

---

## 1.5.3 Achievements for Tournaments
### Current Issue:
Tournament winners and participants do not receive visible recognition for their achievements, which may reduce motivation.

### Suggested Improvements:
- Introduce achievements for tournament winners, including first, second, and third places, to reward their success and encourage competitiveness.

---

## 1.5.4 Tournament History
### Current Issue:
Users cannot access information about past tournaments, limiting their ability to review and reflect on previous events.

### Suggested Improvements:
- Create a visible tournament history section to allow users to explore past events and results.

---

## 1.5.5 My Annotations Section
### Current Issue:
There is no dedicated section for users to view and manage their personal annotations, making it harder to organize feedback.

### Suggested Improvements:
- Add a "My Annotations" section where users can store, view, and manage their notes and feedback for better usability.

## 1.6 What could have been done differently

Going back to the start, we could have done several things differently. First of all, some of the key features that we have implemented have been planned during the semester, which loaded a weight onto Frontend and Mobile teams. Instead of this, we could have planned our app in a more detailed manner so that teams can individually distribute the workload better. Furthermore, although Backend team was able to implement all the planned functionalities, they were late at structuring api input and outputs, which became a bottleneck in development phase, as Frontend and Mobile teams could not start developing their corresponding components and they wasted time while trying to run the backend on their local computers. Finally, we were late at communicating Frontend and Mobile teams, which caused several design decisions to differ across these platforms.


# 2 Progress Based On Teamwork

## 2.1 Work performed by each member

To track our individual efforts, we have kept using our [RAM](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/CMPE-451-%E2%80%90-Responsibility-Assignment-Matrix-(RAM)). Details can be found there in a tabular format.

## 2.3 API Endpoints

### 2.3.1 API Documentation

We are using Swagger UI for API documentation purposes. It can be accessed [here](http://34.32.78.191:8080/swagger-ui/index.html).

### 2.3.2 Link to the API

Same with the documentation link, our API can be tested [here](http://34.32.78.191:8080/swagger-ui/index.html).

### 2.3.3 Example API Calls

```javascript
const fetchPostData = async () =>{
        try{
            const postRes = await axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/v1/posts/new/${id}`,
                {
                    headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("jwt_token")}`}
                }
            );
            const annotationRes = await axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/v1/annotations/get?postId=${id}`,
                {
                    headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("jwt_token")}`}
                }
            );
            setPublishedAnnotations(annotationRes.data);
            setPostData(postRes.data);
        }
        catch(e){
            setPostData(getPostFromId(id)); 
        }
} 
```
Here is a frontend function that calls two endpoints to fetch post and annotation data. The responses look like this.\
Post Response:
```json

# 3 Standard

We have implemented an annotation feature that complies with the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) standard. Users can post annotations in post body texts using the web application, and can view annotations posted by other users in both the web and the mobile applications. Annotated text in post bodies is highlighted/underlined to make it easier for users to notice. Users can click/tap on annotated text to read the respective annotation.

# 4 Scenarios

We have created a comprehensive [user scenario](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/User-Scenario), encompassing all the core functionalities of our app.


# 5 Individual Contributions
## [Yekta Ercul, Group8-Backend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Yekta-Eren-Ercul)

- Responsibilities:

I was primarily responsible for improving our backend testing framework, refactoring the GCP bucket file system, and maintaining backend integrity through reviews and feedback on new features. Additionally, I contributed to finalizing project features and the milestone presentation outline.

- Main Contributions:

I focused on strengthening the backend by addressing critical improvements and fixing important possible bugs. I started by refactoring the GCP bucket file system to use public URLs and configured GCP bucket CORS to ensure frontend and mobile compatibility [#465](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/465). This was implemented as a hot-fix and deployed immediately.
Next, I wrote an integration test to verify the entire flow, including signup, login, category follow, and post creation. This involved creating a mock HTTP server using TestRestTemplate provided by Spring and a separate PostgreSQL test database to maintain production integrity [#399](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/399), [#406](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/406), [PR](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/447).
I collaborated with Oğuz to identify and define the remaining features needed for the milestone, contributing to issue tracking and solution development [#402](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/402).
For the presentation, I provided bullet points, suggested a basic outline, and helped refine the final structure, [#461](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/461). I also supported the live presentation by navigating through web and mobile interfaces while Oğuz presented [Lab 9 Report](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Lab-9-Report), [#444](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/444). And finally I have updated the [Requirements](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/CMPE451-%E2%80%90-Requirements) and provided the report with the final status part, [#467](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/468). And I have updated our [Class Diagram UML](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Class-Diagrams) regarding the given feedbacks, [#467](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/467).

## [Ersel Çanakçılı, Group8-Frontend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Ersel-%C3%87anak%C3%A7%C4%B1l%C4%B1)



- Responsibilities:

We have almost covered all the requirements on Milestone 2. In this milestone, the entire frontend team gathered to complete the remaining requirements. In summary, we worked together to implement and finalize the remaining parts.

- Main Contributions:

We implemented pagination on the profile page and made some improvements such as changing passwords and editing profile pictures [#430](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/430). We also implemented pagination on the search page and added a new tab to display users [#427](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/427). Additionally, we refactored the create post dialog by adding design properties to enable users to include more details about their designs [#435](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/435). We then implemented pagination on the feed page [#436](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/436). Furthermore, we added new features such as the ability to edit posts [#451](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/451) and delete posts [#452](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/452). We also allowed users to search by tag by simply clicking on a tag in a post [#453](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/453). Finally, we improved the UI for annotations [#454](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/454).

| Update RAM | [#466](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/466)

- Pull Requests:

Since we worked closely as a team, we were aware of what everyone was doing and the code that needed to be merged. This allowed us to merge changes smoothly. I approved [#432](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/432) and [#437](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/437), and I created [#448](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/448).

- Unit Tests:

In the second milestone, we wrote tests to verify the core functionalities. In this milestone, we reused those tests to ensure consistency and reliability.

## [Oğuz Kağnıcı, Group8-Backend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Oğuz-Kağnıcı)


- Responsibilities:
I was mainly working on improving and finalizing existing features and making small additions based on the feedback from the second customer milestone. I have also tracked the progress of Frontend and Mobile teams.

- Main Contributions:
I have spent most of my time deciding which improvements we need to make for the final milestone. Initially, I have conducted a research on design specification of 3D models, as it was one of the features that were requested after the second milestone. [#429](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/429) Then, based on the current situations of Backend, Frontend and Mobile; I have created a list that includes the remaining work for each team and I have written it to the [Lab 9 Report](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Lab-9-Report). [#420](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/420) For the implementation part, I have started by integrating post tags into the semantic search flow. [#415](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/415) Additionally, I have designed a new endpoint, which allows users to search posts just by tags. [#446](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/446) Next, I have designed several other achievements to enhance user experience. [#417](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/417) Concluding the implementation phase, I have implemented user search feature, which allows users to find other users with the search bar. [#404](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/404) I have also implemented post update and delete features. [#419](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/419) Following that, I have written several unit tests mainly for the Wikidata service and several other services. [#443](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/443) Next, I have prepared the outline for our presentation. [#444](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/444) Finally, I have written Executive Summary and Status of Requirements sections in this report. [#442](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/442)

- Unit Tests:
During the time between second and third customer milestones, I have written unit tests for [WikidataService](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/blob/main/3Design/backend/threedesign/src/test/java/boun/group8/threedesign/service/WikidataServiceTest.java) and [PostService](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/blob/main/3Design/backend/threedesign/src/test/java/boun/group8/threedesign/service/PostServiceTest.java). For WikidataService, my test were overall checking whether the retrieved sibling and parent instances were accurate. For PostService, I have focused more on post deletion and tried to cover edge cases, such as preventing deletion of not owned posts. Further details can be found [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/443).


- Additional Information:
I have tracked the progress and design consistencies of Frontend and Mobile. I also participated in all meetings. Finally, I have refactored sequence diagrams and mockups.

## [Onur Çerli, Group8-Mobile](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Onur-%C3%87erli)

- Responsibilities:
  As a member of the mobile team, I was responsible for bringing minor app updates for consistency with the frontend like changing the default gallery-discussion post selection to gallery, changing icons for reaction buttons. There were some bugs with reactions. So I was also responsible for updating them. Another responsibility I had was implementing the achievements feature in the profile screen and making the backend integration. My last responsibility was taking the apk build of the application before the milestone.

- Main Contributions:
  After the second customer milestone, I changed the default selection as gallery for gallery-discussion selection for both category posts and generic feed posts ([#422](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/422)). Then, I worked on fixing reactions; like and dislike ([#424](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/424)). I updated their icons for similarity with frontend. I changed their event handlers so that they work as intended. Then, I implemented the achievements feature in mobile ([#426](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/426)), integrated it with backend and tested it. Additional to these, I have participated in discussions, meetings and tested the application, reviewed and provided feedback for other features to the other members. Lastly, before the third customer milestone I have taken the apk build of the application.
