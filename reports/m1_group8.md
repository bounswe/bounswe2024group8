# 1 Executive Summary

## 1.1 Summary of project status

### 1.1.1 Summary

Our project is to create a vibrant and interactive discussion forum dedicated to 3D art. By integrating features like 3D Model viewing, categories for genres, and weekly competition events, our platform caters specifically to 3D artists and people who appreciate such content. Utilizing the Wikidata API and semantic browsing, we aim to significantly enhance the search functionality within the app, allowing users to find information and content more efficiently and intuitively. Users can register and personalize their accounts, engage with others by creating or interacting with posts and comments within their favorite category and enjoy a rich social experience around their art passion. Key functionalities include account management, category and user following, and interactive events to spice up the competition. Our aim is to enhance the social media landscape for 3D art enthusiasts, offering a web and mobile application that centralizes discussions, fosters art spirit, and offer users a tailored platform for inspiration. Currently, we have completed the overall infrastructure in Backend, Frontend and Mobile, although only certain features are fully available as of the first milestone, such as 3D object interaction and full-fledged authentication. Furthermore, we have deployed our app in a containerized format, following the best practices.

### 1.1.2 Planned Changes
Based on our experience during the design phase of the project, we have decided to modify our methods, as we have observed that there is an obvious room for improvement in certain fields. Hands down the most crucial topic that we have to develop is our communication routine. We weren't able to fully sustain in-team communication due to various problems, such as Discord ban. Furthermore, we are also planning to ramp up the development pace, since it is inevitable to encounter certain issues on the way, which is difficult to circumvent in a limited time. Finally, based on the feedback, we are going to populate the ways our users are rewarded. These ways include commenting to discussion posts, creating more designs and liking others' content.

## 1.2 Summary of customer feedback and reflections

### 1.2.1 Points System
- **Current Issue**: The system currently awards only tournament points, which is seen as insufficient for recognizing a variety of user contributions.
- **Suggested Improvement**: Introduce additional point types to reward other engagement forms, such as contributing to discussions, creating valuable content, and assisting other users. This addition would encourage active participation and increase user motivation.

### 1.2.2 Notification System
- **Current Issue**: Users must frequently check the site to stay updated, leading to potential missed information.
- **Suggested Improvement**: Implement a customizable notification system to alert users about events, new topics, and updates. Users should be able to select preferred notification types, enhancing their experience and reducing the need for constant site checks.

### 1.2.3 Multimedia Support in Discussions
- **Current Issue**: The current discussion section lacks support for multimedia uploads, limiting users' ability to share information.
- **Suggested Improvement**: Enable multimedia uploads in discussions, allowing attachments such as images, videos, and other file types. This enhancement would promote richer interactions and support users in sharing content more effectively.

## 2.2 Evaluation of the status of deliverables
Although we were very quick and coordinated in the design phase, we slowed down a bit in the development phase. We concur that this is caused by communication issues and insufficient planning. Still, we have managed to complete all the significant deliverables during the time until the first customer milestone.

To be filled





# 3 Evaluation of Tools and Processes

## 3.1 Diagrams

For class diagrams, we utilized draw.io since it already had built-in objects we could use, making our job much easier. Additionally, we could work simultaneously in draw.io in a single project with our work partners, which was a huge advantage.

For sequence diagrams, we have used GitHub editor with mermaid syntax, which was more than enough to create informative sequence diagrams for the scope of our project.

For our use case diagrams, we used Draw.io, which provides sufficient resources to represent our use cases, actors, and the system as a whole.

## 3.2 Communication Media

We started with a special group on Discord as our main medium of communication, complemented by a single WhatsApp group. We also used Discord for meetings. After Discord was banned, we utilized WhatsApp communities to separate the special work groups into individual WhatsApp groups, managing them through a single community. Our meetings were then held on Google Meets.

## 3.3 Project Plan

We used GitHub Project and its roadmap functionality since it is very easy to connect them to issues opened, and we could organize them by date in the roadmap page, allowing us to see the future, past, and present progress and move accordingly.

## 3.4 Backend

We used Spring Boot as it is a trusted and well-built backend framework with great built-in libraries for authorization, organization, and more.

## 3.5 Database

We used PostgreSQL because it integrates well with Spring Boot, offering reliability, ACID compliance, and a strong support community. Its ability to handle complex queries and indexing also made it an ideal choice for our highly relational database structure.

## 3.6 Frontend

We are using React JS with webpack package bundler for our frontend application. React is currently the most popular library for frontend applications. Users create and publish several UI libraries, components for React. This makes it so much easier to make applications smooth and functional.

## 3.7 Mobile

We are using React Native as the mobile framework, and we utilize Expo to simplify the development and build process. Both of these are widely regarded as very dependable options by the community, and it makes perfect sense for us to use this stack.

## 3.8 Cloud and Deployment

We used Docker containers which are deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM instances because of ease of stable version management, CI/CD processes and quality of these tools.

# 4 Individual Contributions
## [Yekta Ercul](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Yekta-Eren-Ercul)


- Responsibilities:
For this project until first Milestone, I focused on backend development, documentation, and creating class diagrams. Additionally, I contributed to the design of the semantic search structure and provided guidance to teammates.

- Main Contributions:
I started by rewriting the homepage [#203](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/203) and updating requirements [#204](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/204), which included adding the Tournament and Challenge requirements and refactoring. I also created and updated class diagrams [#209](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/209). Moreover, I implemented a basic solid backend [#228](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/228), connected the database [#224](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/224), and created signup [#221](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/221) and login [#225](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/225) endpoints. And finally, I finalized how we are going to implement the semantic search for our backend [#219](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/219) and explained it to Oguz for him to implement it in backend. My contributions helped establish a foundational structure for further development in backend.

- Pull Requests:  
   I have reviewed the pull request for 3d model viewer feature and addition of mock posts to feed screen [#247](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/247). Then, after I finalized the mobile application implementation for the first customer application by building apk file for the application, I created pull request to merge our project files for mobile application to main branch [#252](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/252).

## [Deniz Ulaş Poyraz](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Deniz-Ula%C5%9F-Poyraz)

- Responsibilities:
For this semester, I will be working on the frontend application and for the first milestone, I have been assigned a few documentation tasks and several frontend component implementations.

- Main Contributions:
I have spent most of my time on implementation tasks. For the first week, I've just updated my wiki page and discussed our project domain. After we determined the project domain, I started researching about W3C standards [#202](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/202) and 3D Viewer React libraries. I commented several options for the standards and I wrote a simple component for the 3D Library. The third week I created 4 scenarios for our project [#208](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/208) , I reviewed and contributed to the sequence diagram created by Oğuz [#215](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/215). I also initialized our frontend project [#229](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/229) and implemented the main Login [#226](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/208) and Sign Up [#223](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/208) components. I made them compatible for backend integration and created several validation logics. For the forth week I took the meeting notes during our lab session. I also continued on developing the frontend app. I created the create post component [#232](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/232), improved the home page [#231](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/231) and completed the feed component [#231](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/231).

- Pull Requests:
I initialized our project and implemented the components alone at first, thats why I did not create new branches and I did not create any pull requests. After my other colleague also started coding I made this pull request [p243](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/243) and right before the first demo I made this pull request [p250](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/pull/250) to merge our frontend branch into main. I also reviewed several feature PR requests and approved them.

- **Responsibilities**

For this project, I am working on mobile app development. For the first milestone, I was assigned organization and documentation tasks. As I am new to mobile development, JavaScript, and React Native, I did not contribute to code development for the first milestone but focused on learning the concepts.

- **Main Contributions**

I mainly contributed to communication and organizational tasks. I also assisted with documentation and design by creating documents and contributing to class diagrams.

## [Huseyin Turker Erdem](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Huseyin-Turker-Erdem)
- Responsibilities: In the project, I am working in the frontend team and completing tasks about the deployment of the project. For the first customer milestone, I was responsible for:

  - W3C Standard Determination
  - Sequence Diagrams
  - Deployment of Frontend and Backend to the Cloud
  - Frontend Initialization
  - Frontend Signup Page
  - Frontend Login Page
  - Frontend Home Page
  - Stable Docker Containerization

- Main Contributions:

  - I implemented some parts of the frontend project with the frontend team, one of which is connecting our frontend project to the already deployed backend (API).
  - Other than the implementation of the frontend, I created a GCP environment for the deployment of backend and frontend. I also designed Dockerfiles accordingly.

   Since we did worked on the frontend project face-to-face in order to quickly prepare the necessary implementations, issues [#223](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/223), [#226](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/226) and [#229](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/issues/229) (which I was also assigned to) are coded and pushed by [Ersel Canakcili](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Ersel-%C3%87anak%C3%A7%C4%B1l%C4%B1) and [Deniz Ulas Poyraz](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/wiki/Deniz-Ula%C5%9F-Poyraz). We checked each other's codes and pushed that into the main frontend branch, which is [3design_frontend](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group8/tree/3design_frontend). That is why i was not assigned any pull requests, because we focused on creating the tree of these branches at that time.
